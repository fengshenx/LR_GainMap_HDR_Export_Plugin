# HEIC Exporter for lightroom
This is a Lightroom plugin that can change the output file to Heic format.

Although Lightroom currently supports Heic display, it does not support output in Heic format. This plug-in will solve this problem.

Note: Currently only Lightroom Classic and MacOS are supported.

# Instructions
* Find the plug-in manager and add the plug-in.
* Select the photos you want to export
* Open the export dialog box and select "Export to HEIC" at the top.
* Start export

Because this plug-in first exports to an intermediate format and then converts it to HEIC, it is recommended that the intermediate format be selected as TIFF to ensure the best image quality.
